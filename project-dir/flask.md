index.html
//This template creates a contact form with various form fields (firstname, lastname, email, country, message, gender, and subject). It uses the custom_macros.html template to render the checkboxes for the subject field. Additionally, a hidden field email_confirm acts as a honeypot to trap spam bots. The form data will be submitted to the server using the POST method.
// to prevent from attacks
{{ form.csrf_token }}
    This line includes a hidden input field in the form, which is used to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. It generates a unique token that must be sent along with the form data to verify its authenticity.
<div class="hidden-field">
    {{ form.email_confirm.label }}
    {{ form.email_confirm(size=20) }}
</div>
    This block of code creates a hidden field to act as a honeypot. It is a hidden <div> element containing the label and input field for the email_confirm field. Since the field is hidden, legitimate users won't see it, but bots might fill it, indicating possible spam.

//some explanation of different parts of this file
<p>
    {{ form.firstname.label }}
    {{ form.firstname(size=20) }}
</p>
    This block of code creates a paragraph (<p>) element containing the label and input field for the firstname form field. The label is displayed first, and then the text input field is rendered with a size of 20 characters.

{% if form.firstname.errors %}
    This line checks if there are any errors associated with the firstname field. If there are errors, the code inside the block will be executed.

<ul class="errors">
    {% for error in form.firstname.errors %}
        <li>{{ error }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
    This block of code generates an unordered list (<ul>) with the class errors. It iterates over each error in the firstname field's error list and creates a list item (<li>) for each error message.
{% endblock %}
    This line marks the end of the content block.
<ul>
    {% for subfield in form.subject %}
        <li>{{ custom_macros.render_checkbox(subfield) }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
    This block of code generates an unordered list (<ul>) containing the checkboxes for the subject field. It uses a for loop to iterate over each subfield (checkbox) in the subject field and renders it using the custom macro render_checkbox from custom_macros.
<div class="hidden-field">
    {{ form.email_confirm.label }}
    {{ form.email_confirm(size=20) }}
</div>
    This block of code creates a hidden field to act as a honeypot. It is a hidden <div> element containing the label and input field for the email_confirm field. Since the field is hidden, legitimate users won't see it, but bots might fill it, indicating possible spam.
<p>
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
</p>
    This block of code creates a paragraph (<p>) element containing the submit button. When clicked, it will submit the form data to the server for processing.

forms.py
//Overall, forms.py defines the CourseForm class, which represents the contact form used in the application. It contains various form fields with their corresponding validators, choices, and other attributes. The honeypot field (email_confirm) is also included to help protect against spam.

Explanation of forms.py file



from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import (StringField, TextAreaField, IntegerField, BooleanField,
                     RadioField, SelectField, SelectMultipleField)
from wtforms.validators import InputRequired, Length, Email, DataRequired
    These lines import the necessary modules and classes needed to define and handle forms using Flask-WTF and WTForms.
country_choices = [
    ('', 'Select a country'),
    ('USA', 'United States'),
    ('CAN', 'Canada'),
    ('UK', 'United Kingdom'),
    ('AUS', 'Australia'),
    # Add more countries as needed
]
    country_choices is a list that contains tuples representing the available country options for the SelectField. Each tuple contains two elements: the value that will be sent to the server when the form is submitted, and the label that will be displayed to the user in the form.
class CourseForm(FlaskForm):
    This line defines a new class CourseForm that inherits from FlaskForm, the base class provided by Flask-WTF to create forms.
    firstname = StringField('FirstName', validators=[InputRequired(),
                                             Length(min=2, max=100)])
    This line defines a form field called firstname. It is of type StringField, representing a text input field, with a label "FirstName". It is required (InputRequired()) and should have a length between 2 and 100 characters (Length(min=2, max=100)).
     #implementation of honeypot
    email_confirm = StringField('Email Confirm')
     #implementation of honeypot
    email_confirm = StringField('Email Confirm')
        This line defines a form field called email_confirm. It is of type StringField, representing a text input field. This field acts as a honeypot, a technique to trap bots by creating a hidden field that should not be filled by users. If this field is filled, it indicates possible spam.

app.py file
//It handles form submissions, validates the form, and prevents spam submissions using the honeypot technique.
explanation of app.py file:
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for
from forms import CourseForm, country_choices
    Import necessary modules
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your secret key'
    Here, you create a Flask application instance and set a secret key. The secret key is used for securely signing session cookies and other security-related purposes.
courses_list = [{
    'firstname': 'John',
    'lastname': 'Doe',
    'email': 'john.doe@example.com',
    'message': 'Learn Python basics',
    'gender': True,
    'subject': ['repair', 'order', 'others'],
    'repair': True,
    'order': True,
    'others': False
}]
    This dictionary contains sample data for a course. The data will be used to prepopulate the form with default values when the page is loaded.
@app.route('/', methods=('GET', 'POST'))
def index():
    form = CourseForm()
    form.country.choices = country_choices
    In this route, you create an instance of the CourseForm class and set the available country choices for the country field.
if form.validate_on_submit():
    # Check the honeypot field
    if form.email_confirm.data:
        # This is likely a spam submission, reject it
        return "Sorry, this form submission is not allowed."

    # Get the data from the form
    firstname = form.firstname.data
    lastname = form.lastname.data
    email = form.email.data
    country = form.country.data
    message = form.message.data
    gender = form.gender.data
    subjects = form.subject.data
    return redirect(url_for('success'))
    Here, you check if the form is submitted and valid. If the form is valid, you also check the honeypot field email_confirm.data. If this field has any data (which it shouldn't), it indicates a potential spam submission, and the form submission is rejected with a message. Otherwise, the form data is retrieved and redirected to the success route.
return render_template('index.html', form=form)
    If the form is not submitted or is not valid, the template index.html is rendered with the form object.
@app.route('/success')
def success():
    return "Form submitted successfully!"
    In this route, a simple success message is returned when the form submission is successful.

    methods=('GET', 'POST'): This part of the decorator specifies the HTTP methods that the function can handle. By including both 'GET' and 'POST', the function index() can handle both types of requests.

When a user visits the root URL, a GET request is sent by default. The index() function will be executed and will render the index.html template with an empty form, allowing the user to input data.

When the user submits the form by clicking the "Send" button, a POST request is sent to the same URL (/). The index() function will be executed again, but this time it will validate the form data, process it, and redirect the user to the success route if the form data is valid. Otherwise, any validation errors will be displayed on the form.

base.html
    The base.html file serves as a base template that defines the overall structure of the webpage. Child templates (e.g., index.html) can extend this base template and fill in the specific content within the {% block content %} block. This allows for consistent layout and styling across multiple pages while allowing each page to have its own unique content.

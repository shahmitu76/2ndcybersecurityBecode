## The mission

You already had the opportunity to learn and use the Bash shell, but there are many other shells one could use. They all have their specificities, strengths and weaknesses; although they all work in similar manner they all answer to specific needs. One could says that knowing a new shell is like having a new tool in your toolset, this challenge will have you add [Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) to it.

Powershell is one of the **most common shells** in modern **Windows systems**, it has a different approach to Bash in that it manipulates [data types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/lang-spec/chapter-04?view=powershell-7.1) instead of exclusively text I/O (_input/output_). Furthermore, since it's developped by Microsoft it's also deeply integrated into Windows enebling extensive Windows system configuration.

> **NOTE**: Powershell is actually not a Windows exclusive shell, it can easily be used in Linux as well. However some of its functionalities are Windows specific and some of the exercises below will only be doable on a Windows system.
